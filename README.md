# Nand2Tetris

Projects from the Coursera course **[From Nand to Tetris: Part I & II](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)**

This project-based course is one of the highest-rated on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). It guides learners through the complete journey of **building a modern computer system from scratch**â€”starting with a single NAND gate.

Throughout the course, I implemented:

* Core **hardware components** (logic gates, ALU, registers, memory) using Hardware Description Language (HDL).
* A 16-bit **Hack CPU and Computer Architecture** capable of running custom machine code.
* A **two-pass assembler** that translates Hack assembly into binary machine code.
* A **virtual machine (VM)** for stack arithmetic and program control.
* A **high-level language, compiler, and operating system**, supporting game development and applications.
